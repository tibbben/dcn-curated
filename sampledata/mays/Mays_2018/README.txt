In 2016, a 40 question online survey was administered to 801 undergraduate students at the University of Miami between August and September 2016. The survey is comprised of multiple choice, Likert scale and open-ended questions. The excel spreadsheet is organized with one question per sheet; each sheet includes the response rate, the answers to the question and a simple chart of the results. All results are in aggregate form and no individual respondent can be identified with this data.
